Create LVM

Objective:

The objective of these screenshots is to validate the successful completion of the entire LVM configuration process. They demonstrate that the new virtual disk was correctly initialized as a physical volume, added to a volume group, and used to create a logical volume that was properly formatted with a filesystem. The screenshots also confirm that the logical volume was mounted at the intended mount point and that the /etc/fstab configuration works correctly, ensuring the filesystem will automatically mount after a system reboot. Together, these steps verify that the LVM storage is fully functional, persistent, and ready for use in a production-style Linux environment.
